# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is a study guide which contains notes of the topics that were learnead throught the Prework. My main motivation was to test wheter or not IÂ´m able to do a simple project just with a simple guide of intrunctions. This guide helped me to write down all the important things that were taught throught the prework. I learned a couple new things, like how HTMl is structured. how to create a new CSS file and how to connect that file to the main code, how Javascript works and how to connect the java file to the main code and I also learned how the Gitflow works, how to create a new branch and how to upload all the new changes into the Github repository.
